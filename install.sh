# FreeFrame installer: one command on a fresh Ubuntu or Debian server.
#
#   sudo bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Techiebutler/freeframe/latest/install.sh)"
#
# This small script downloads the freeframe command from the same branch or
# tag and runs `freeframe install` from that download, with the terminal
# attached, so its questions can be answered. It writes nothing itself:
# `freeframe install` puts the command at /usr/local/bin/freeframe once its
# checks have passed and the install goes ahead, so a refused run leaves the
# server as it was.
#
# Answers can be given ahead of time. With bash -c, the word right after the
# script is only its name, so write install there and the options after it.
# sudo drops variables set before it, so put them after it:
#
#   sudo bash -c "$(curl -fsSL .../install.sh)" install --domain review.yourstudio.com
#   sudo FREEFRAME_CHANNEL=stable bash -c "$(curl -fsSL .../stable/install.sh)"
#
# Without a terminal (cloud-init, CI) every answer must be given ahead of
# time with --yes, and the script can then also arrive through a pipe:
#
#   curl -fsSL .../install.sh | sudo FREEFRAME_ADMIN_EMAIL=you@yourstudio.com bash -s -- --yes
#
# A piped run that asks questions does not work under sudo-rs (Ubuntu
# 26.04's sudo): the questions freeze. This script then stops before it
# downloads anything and shows the bash -c form instead.
#
# The branch or tag is --channel when given, otherwise FREEFRAME_CHANNEL,
# otherwise latest.
#
# Everything sits in main(), which runs on the last line, so a download that
# is cut short never runs half a script.
